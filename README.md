The goal of this repo is twofold:

1) Give me practice solving different logic problems
2) Show potential employers (or other coders) my thought process as to how I came to my own solution

Note:  The toy problems and their instructions all come from CodeWars. My many thanks to all the coders
who contributed these problems so we can all learn in a fun way! Also, any positive feedback, suggested
corrections, or alternative solutions are appreciated :)
